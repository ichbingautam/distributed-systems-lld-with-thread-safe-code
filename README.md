# Distributed Systems Low-Level Design (LLD) Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of various **Low-Level Designs (LLDs)** for distributed systems, including:

1. **Ride-Hailing System**
2. **Payment System**
3. **Rate Limiter**
4. **Distributed Logging System**
5. **Real-Time Location Tracking System**
6. **Surge Pricing Algorithm**
7. **Ticket Booking System**
8. **Fraud Detection System**
9. **Distributed Session Management System**
10. **Feature Toggle System**

Each implementation is designed with a **high level of abstraction** and includes follow-up scenarios to address real-world challenges like scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Redis (for distributed session management and spatial indexing)
- Docker (optional, for running Redis in a container)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ichbingautam/distributed-systems-lld-with-thread-safe-code.git
