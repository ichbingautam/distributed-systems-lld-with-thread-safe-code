# Distributed Systems Low-Level Design (LLD) Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of various **Low-Level Designs (LLDs)** for distributed systems, including:

1. **Ride-Hailing System**
2. **Uber Eats - Food Delivery System**
3. **Payment System**
4. **Rate Limiter**
5. **Distributed Logging System**
6. **Real-Time Location Tracking System**
7. **Surge Pricing Algorithm**
8. **Ticket Booking System**
9. **Fraud Detection System**
10. **Distributed Session Management System**
11. **Distributed Cache System**
12. **Leaderboard for Uber Drivers**
13. **Real Time Location Tracker System**
14. **Notification System**
15. **Feature Toggle System**

Each implementation is designed with a **high level of abstraction** and includes follow-up scenarios to address real-world challenges like scalability, reliability, and performance.
